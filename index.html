        Sweden goes Herd Immunity
        </div>    
        <p class="space">
        Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, 
        or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that
        occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, 
        whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection 
        for individuals who lack immunity. cited from Wikipedia

    Why & Media Reactions 
    </div> 
    <p class="space">
    The Swedish legislation doesn not allow the govenment to lockdown the sociaty, including public traffic, schools, restaurants and entertainment 
    and sport branches. The govenment refers very often to the institutions, and this time it's the Public Health Agency of Sweden's turn to shine.
    However, this agency chose to go Herd Immunity and insists it is going right. Journalists and experts including professors and virologs critisized 
    the agency's stratage very often. However, the govenment and the agency always find excuse to explain the consequecies.
